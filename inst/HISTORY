2009-10-19
----------

 Version 1.1-11

- Initialisation of some variables in nifitFMRI.c, slam.unused, sblas.unused and slapack.unused to prevent compiler warnings
- I added function f.read.volume to read a NIFTI or ANALYZE volume file. The function autodetects the format type of the image file
- I modified f.read.analyze.volume and f.read.nifti.volume to always return a 4D array
- I corrected a mistake in the function f.basic.hdr.nifti.list.create where vox.offset and magic fields should reflect the fact that we are in .nii or .img/.hdr NIFTI format

2009-11-03
----------

 Version 1.1-12

- I modified function threeDto4D to (better) check if the headers of all files are the same (depending if we are in NIFTI/Analyze format) 
- I modified function threeDto4D to add a check on datatype and to write the correct number of bytes with readBin/writeBin
- I modified "datatype" entry in f.read.nifti.header.Rd help file
- I modified f.write.nifti function to allow max and min computations when there are NaN values (usefull since SPM uses NaN values as markers for voxels for which it has not calculated any statistics)
- I modified f.write.nii.array.to.img.2bytes, f.write.nii.array.to.img.8bit and f.write.nii.array.to.img.float functions by adding NAOK=TRUE argument to .C calls (usefull since SPM uses NaN values as markers for voxels for which it has not calculated any statistics)
- I modified analyze2nifti function: qform.code and sform.code now take 0 as default values (instead of 2 before). I also added a check to verify if the .mat file exists.
- I added a citation file
- I modified the help file threeDto4D.Rd to warn the user that this function outputs files in the format sent in
- I  modified a few help files before my talk at useR 2010
- I modified the file plot.volume.gui.R to add hscale and vscale factors, thus enabling the possibility to resize the drawing. 
  This is particularly usefull for small laptop screens.
- I modified the file plot.volume.gui.R to correct an error when the visualizer GUI is used with 2D images.
- I modified the function R2Q() to add a qfac parameter. If not provided, we choose it to work with a proper rotation 
  matrix.
- I modified the f.read.header(), f.read.volume() and magicfield() functions to handle the NIFTI-x case (with x in 1...9)
- I modified the file plot.volume.gui.R to add sliders for the anatomical images, and also to take into account the pixdim values
- I modified the f.basic.hdr.list.create() function and its associated documentation to replace mat with X
- I modified the C function read_nifti_header_wrap_JM, the R function f.read.nifit.header() and the associated help file to enable the reading of the extension field, but there is still a problem
- I modified the functions mat34.to.TRSZ() and mat34.to.TZSR() to handle the case of improper rotations.

2011-06-05
----------

 Version 1.1-13

- I modified the file plot.volume.gui.R to correct a bug: the sliders did not move on the anatomical when you clicked on the functional (and vice versa)
- In this same file, I also changed order <- -1 into order <- -1*sign(L$pixdim[2]) (in the function orientation()) and hdr.anat$pixdim[2] into abs(hdr.anat$pixdim[2])

  in file plot.volume.gui.R
- I added a warning when flip is not defined when one uses the GUI (in file f.plot.volume.gui.R)

2013-03-19
----------

2019-06-06
----------

 Version 1.1-19

- Corrected "Nonconforming tab character" warnings in file spatial.filters.linear.f
- Commented lines 1195--1203 in file analyzeFMRI.c since xerbla is now part of R
- To solve "Warning: Obsolescent feature: Old-style character length at", I replaced CHARACTER *x NAME1,NAME2,.. with CHARACTER (LEN=x) :: NAME1,NAME2,.. in files lsame.f, sblas.f and slapack.f
- To solve a NOTE of "checking for non-standard things in the check directory", I added \dontrun{} in files: analyze2nifti.Rd, f.basic.hdr.list.create.Rd, f.basic.hdr.nifti.list.create.Rd,

- I changed in the CITATION file http to https

2020-12-15
----------

 Version 1.1-23

- I moved tkrplot to Suggests field in file DESCRIPTION (because B. Ripley wrote 
  "Package tkrplot supports only two of the three graphical interfaces of Tk, not covering Aqua which is the only 
   one currently available for arm64 Macs.")
- I removed tkrplot in NAMESPACE file
- I changed the source code for the function f.plot.volume.gui() in file niftiFMRI.R accordingly.

2025-07-10
----------

 Version 1.1-25

- Previous version has been archived (by Ripley) on 2022-03-15 as check problems were not corrected despite months of notice.
  I need to not use anymore the header S.h
- In file spatial.filters.non.linear.c, I replaced S.h with R.h
   which then resulted in errors such as: unknown type name ‘Sint’; did you mean ‘uint’
   which I solved by replacing all occurences of Sint (resp., Sint*) with just int (resp., int*)
- I also got this warning: 
   analyzeFMRI.c:880:26: warning: format ‘%s’ expects argument of type ‘char *’, but argument 2 has type ‘short int *’ [-Wformat=]
  which I solved by replacing this line with:
  Rprintf("originator = %d %d %d %d %d \n",
        (*head).originator[0],
        (*head).originator[1],
        (*head).originator[2],
        (*head).originator[3],
        (*head).originator[4]);
- I corrected this: checkRd: (-1) f.read.nifti.header.Rd:153: Lost braces; missing escapes or markup?
- I corrected this:
  Package CITATION file contains call(s) to old-style personList() or
   as.personList().  Please use c() on person objects instead.
   Package CITATION file contains call(s) to old-style citEntry().  Please
   use bibentry() instead.
- I corrected several errors related to Calloc, Realloc and Free not existing anymore 
- In file niftiFMRI.R, I corrected: if (class(array.fonc) == "array" & is.null(hdr.fonc))
- In file analyzeFMRI.c, in function svd_JM, I initialised: int info = 0
